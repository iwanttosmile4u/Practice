/* TASK - 6
 * Rewrite calculator() function, into the Arrow functions, with a new features:
 *
 * Each operation has its own function.
 * That means - we will have sum(a,b) for summing, multiple(a,b) for multiplying and so on.
 * Each of this functions need only two arguments,
 * and returns only the result of the operation with this two numbers
 * If the function hasn't receive any of two arguments, assign 0 as a default value.
 *
 * The calculate() functions will be the main one.
 * Is takes three arguments:
 *   1 - integer number
 *   2 - integer number
 *   3 - the function needs to be used for this two numbers
 * So we have a picture like this:
 * the main function inside itself will call the function with the operation.
 * This construction is useful, if we need to do some operations with numbers before calculating.

const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const mult = (a, b) => a * b;
const divide = (a, b) => a / b;
const substr = (a, b) => a * b;

const calculate = (num1, num2, callBack) => {
  return callBack(num1, num2);
};

console.log(calculate(2, 3, mult));
